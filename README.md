# Node.js Boilerplate with Express, PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM, and Vitest

This is a boilerplate project for building a Node.js application using Express, PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM, and Vitest for testing. It provides a basic structure to get you started quickly with these technologies.

## Features

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **Express**: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **PostgreSQL**: Powerful, open-source object-relational database system.
- **Drizzle ORM**: Lightweight, TypeScript-first ORM for SQL databases.
- **Vitest**: Fast unit test framework powered by Vite.
